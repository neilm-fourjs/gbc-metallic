# GBC Metallic Customisation

A Metallic theme based on my the gbc-clean customisation.

It uses not javascript and very few scss overrides, the bulk of the styling is done in the theme.scss.json file.

## Folders
* screenshots : The screenshots for this README
* gbc-metallic : The files for the custom GBC
* distbin : place for zip of GBC


## Building
This was written and tested on Linux. The Makefile and Script are to setup additional folders and to build the GBC.
* 1. The GBC prerequisites building ( grunt nodejs git ) plus: make & zip installed
* 2. Set GBCPROJECTDIR=<folder containing fjs-gbc project.zip file>
 
```
$ git clone <repo url>
$ cd <folder cloned>

```
